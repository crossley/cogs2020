# COGS2020 — Experimental Design and Data Analysis for the Cognitive and Brain Sciences

This repository contains lecture materials, tutorials, and
example datasets for **COGS2020**, a second-year unit taught
at Macquarie University.

The unit introduces core ideas in experimental design and
statistical analysis as used in cognitive science,
psychology, and neuroscience, alongside practical skills for
working with experimental data in **R**.

Students learn how experiments generate data, how
experimental design influences data structure, and how to
move from raw observations to clear statistical conclusions
through visualisation and statistical analysis. Perhaps more
critically, students develop critical thinking skills for
evaluating data and analyses in the scientific literature,
and for designing their own experiments and analyses in
future research projects.

## Topics covered

Across the semester the material covers:

* programming and data handling in R
* data wrangling using `data.table`
* data visualisation with `ggplot2`
* principles of experimental design
* descriptive and inferential statistics
* hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
* ANOVA and regression within the general linear model framework

The emphasis throughout is on practical, reproducible data analysis grounded in real experimental problems.
